Payment date candidates found: Document 1 (lender tax certification, undated) states 'DUE DATES: February and July' with 'December 2024 taxes $1119.23 PAID' and 'June 2025 taxes $1118.23 UNPAID'. Document 2 (official Montgomery County, dated 10/5/25) shows Tax Year 2024 with both installments FULLY PAID ($0.00 unpaid balance for 1st Half, 2nd Half, and Full Year). 2. CRITICAL MULTI-DOCUMENT SCENARIO ANALYSIS: Document 2 (official) shows '2024 PAID, $0 balance' (historical year). Document 1 (lender) references 'December 2024 taxes PAID' and 'June 2025 taxes UNPAID'. However, upon closer examination, both documents are discussing the SAME tax year (2024), not different tax years. The lender document's reference to 'June 2025 taxes' refers to the payment DUE in June 2025 for the 2024 tax year (2nd half installment). The official county document dated 10/5/25 shows this same 2024 tax year is now FULLY PAID with $0.00 balance. 3. RECENCY OVERRIDE: The official county document (dated 10/5/25) is MORE RECENT than the lender certification (undated, but references unpaid June 2025 installment, suggesting it was created before that payment was made). The official document shows the current status as of 10/5/25: all 2024 taxes are PAID. 4. Applying PAID algorithm (amountDueAtClosing = $0.00): Extract payment schedule from semi-annual dates (February/July). Normalized dates: 2025-02-28 (1st half 2025), 2025-07-31 (2nd half 2025), 2026-02-28 (1st half 2026), 2026-07-31 (2nd half 2026). 5.

PAID algorithm: Filter to future dates only (>= 2025-11-04). Future dates exist: [2026-02-28, 2026-07-31]. Select EARLIEST future date = 2026-02-28. STOP. 7. Selected nextTaxPaymentDate: 2026-02-28 (earliest future payment date). 8. Selected followingTaxPaymentDate: 2026-07-31 (next installment in semi-annual schedule). 9. FINAL RESOLUTION: Using official county document (more recent, shows current PAID status): taxYear='2024', amountDueAtClosing=$0.00, annualizedAmountDue=$2,237.46, dates from payment schedule per PAID algorithm."
